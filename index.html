          I'm trained in traditional mediums like charcoal, ink, and graphite
          but I fell in love with digital illustration. Please check out my
          illustrations on behance!

          I'm a huge fan of Fantasy, Sci-fi, and Horror! My favourite authors are
          Brandon Sanderson, Stephen King, and Frank Herbert. I'm currently not reading
