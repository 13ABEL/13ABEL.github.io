This is just a personal website I've been playing around with! I'm a huge fan of simplicity so
this website will (hopefully) reflect that

My intention with this website is to primarily accomplish 3 things:
  1. Create a website (???) to link to all my other accounts (eg. Github, Behance, etc)
  2. Practice some design skills (font pairing + positioning)
  3. Practice some web design skills using new tools (eg. SASS)
